# PREREQUISITES
  
There are some things you'll need for the course before you start. Of couse, if you wish to learn outside the course, there are different things you can play with but I shall list as many as I can that I think are relevant to learning Python
  
  
## Windows

* Python 3- http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.3.2/#download select the appropriate version for the processor 'Python 3.3.2 Windows x86 MSI Installer' for Intel, 'Windows X86-64 MSI Installer' for AMD64 processors.  
  	
* Notepad ++ - http://notepad-plus-plus.org/ This is a great editor under windows and works pretty well.
  		
* Pyglet Library - *Alpha 1.21 Release* - http://www.pyglet.org/download.html Another great little Library. It's a bit more lightweight than PyGame.
  
## OSX (10.6+)

* Python 3 - This is already installed but you need to run it from the 'terminal.app' using the command 'python3'
	
* Text Wrangler - http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/ Its free as in Beer, which is great and it has a lot of functions. Cant be bad!
		
* Pyglet Library - http://www.pyglet.org/download.html

## Linux

Generally, this is up to your distribution. Under ubuntu you can do the following:

    apt-get install python3
    apt-get install python3-dev
    apt-get install python-pyglet

You'll probably have a text editor you like already. Kate and Gedit are great for this sort of thing but emacs, vi, vim, nano, Komodo edit etc etc are all fine too!
