Python Course Code Ideas


1) deliberate mistakes in each part
2) super class and class - DONE
3) mixins
4) for loops - DONE
5) Decorators - DONE (ish)
6) Lambda Functions
7) Dictionaries - DONE (ish)
8) Lists - DONE (ish)
9) class strings (__str__)
10) sorting on lists? (maybe as an aside)
11) Interactive mode (side by side as examples in the pacman code come in)
12) advanced looping with each (and similar)
13) Types?
14) File IO
15) Binary Operations?
16) Lines like this:
	sine_table = dict((x, sin(x*pi/180)) for x in range(0, 91))
	unique_words = set(word  for line in page  for word in line.split())
	valedictorian = max((student.gpa, student.name) for student in graduates)


*) Examples codes for networking, opengl, hacking, django?
*) Book listing?
*) Website resources
*) Python cheat sheets for me and the course!
*) requirements - LiveCD? Probably not but definitely a list and a CD with things on
*)
