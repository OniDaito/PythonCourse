Python Course Code Ideas


REDO For Bomberman!

1) deliberate mistakes in each part
2) super class and class
3) mixins
4) for loops
5) Decorators
6) Lambda Functions
7) Dictionaries
8) Lists
9) class strings (__str__)
10) sorting on lists? (maybe as an aside)
11) Interactive mode (side by side as examples in the pacman code come in)
12) advanced looping with each (and similar)
13) Types?
14) File IO
15) Binary Operations?
16) Lines like this:
	sine_table = dict((x, sin(x*pi/180)) for x in range(0, 91))
	unique_words = set(word  for line in page  for word in line.split())
	valedictorian = max((student.gpa, student.name) for student in graduates)

17) Exceptions!

*) Examples codes for networking, opengl, hacking, django?
*) Book listing?
*) Website resources
*) Python cheat sheets for me and the course!
*) requirements - LiveCD? Probably not but definitely a list and a CD with things on
*) REDO the permissions and game logic - Lookahead one square and just say whether
or not we can move into it!


Code layout plan:

1) Basic intro - print statement, function, includes, basic decorator, instantiation
	- Potentially paste each line into the interpreter and run __str__, dir() etc
	- make menton of the co-ordinate system at this point

2) Creation of a grid - basic class structure and more imports (import from)
	- __doc__ string show
	
3) Creation of grid - loop structures
